          <p style="font-size:18px">We at One World aim at the 21st curriculum reducing content and focusing on conceptual understanding. Students are encouraged to develop deeper understanding and are provided with opportunities for self discovery and self learning. Learners here are challenged to think, reflect, internalize and express. They are encouraged to take charge of their own learning, engage readily with activities, ask questions and use technology. Regular and periodic assessment in the form of Formative and Summative using a variety of tools and techniques help in identifying the levels of attainment.</p>
